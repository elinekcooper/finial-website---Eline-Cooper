        <div class="container">

            <img src="images/typographic systems -  axial.png" alt="axial typography task" class="flexImage">

            <div class="content">Axial typographic design is where elements are designed on adjacent axes. <br><br>
                In hindsight this design is too similar to my dilational design just in a square rather than a round
                format. If I were to repeatedly complete this project, I would probably change it to look more like the
                content on the miro boards, with blocks of text aligned perpendicular. I could have also made more of a
                maze like design. </div>

    <!--   RADIAL   -->

        <div class="container">

            <img src="images/typographic systems -  radial.png" alt="radial typography task" class="flexImage">

            <div class="content">Radial type is when each text ‘radiates’ from a focal point, like spokes on a bike
                wheel. <br><br>
                This design is definitely one of my more simple ones, I feel like I did not push this design as far as I
                could have. It ends up looking pretty similar to what other people have made. </div>

            <img src="images/typographic systems -  dilatational.png" alt="dilatational typography task"
                class="flexImage">

            <div class="content">Dilatational typographic designs are defined through their use of concentric rings.
                <br><br>
                I think this design is what is expected from a dilatational typography project however this is still one
                of my favourites. I like how the composition draws your eye to the centre and the variety with the text
                size.

            <div class="content">Defined by the lack of rules applied to a composition. <br> <br>
                I tried to lean into this concept and have some fun with it, putting some of my text flipped
                horizontally, in German and in wingdings font. Because I was able to ignore a lot of the rules used in
                my other designs this one turned out the most unique and interesting. </div>

            <div class="content">All text and graphics being organised into rows and columns. <br> <br>
                This was surprisingly difficult for me to come up with a design that I found good enough to present, I
                went through about five different designs. In the end I did manage to come up with something that met my
                standards. </div>

    <!--   MODULAR   -->

        <div class="container">

            <img src="images/typographic systems -  modular.png" alt="modular typography task" class="flexImage">

            <div class="content">Shown through the repetition of structures, modular types can often look very broken up
                or segmented. <br><br>
                To keep it looking modular I used a repeating shape of blocks so it looked like it could be rearranged
                into a new composition. Because of how the text is organised, and aligned it is probably the most
                legible of all of my designs. If I were to redo this design I would add some more detail to make the
                piece more interesting. </div>

            <img src="images/typographic systems -  transitional.png" alt="transitional typography task"
                class="flexImage">

            <div class="content">Transitional type is where text moves freely, rather than on an axis. <br><br>
                Arguably transitional is one of the most dynamic typographic systems. I tried to show a feeling of
                movement and flow throughout my work by using the type on a path tool in Illustrator. I really like this
                design, I feel like for this one I struck the right balance between having a minimalist, clean design
                and not being so simple that it looks like other’s work.

            <div class="content">Defined by their symmetry, placing each design element centred on an axis.<br><br>
                I like this design idea more in theory than in practice. I could have added some more detail to make the
                design more visually interesting then it is. </div>
